    "🌀 Bubble Sort – Sorting Student IDs Like Organizing a Messy Desk\n",
    "Imagine you have a stack of student records, all jumbled up. Your job? Sort them by student ID—but you can only compare two at a time! That’s Bubble Sort in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔎 How It Works\n",
    "1️⃣ Start at the top of the list. 2️⃣ Compare each student’s ID with the next one. 3️⃣ If they’re in the wrong order, swap them! 4️⃣ Keep repeating this until the entire list is neatly sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 What Makes Bubble Sort Unique?\n",
    "✅ Looks inside each student’s record to check the ID, rather than just sorting raw numbers. ✅ Swaps entire student entries—not just IDs, but names, departments, everything!\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ The Downsides\n",
    "💨 Slow for big lists—Bubble Sort does a lot of unnecessary swaps. 🔁 Even if most IDs are sorted, it still checks every single one, making extra work. 🧠 Best case? If the list is already sorted, it runs faster with fewer checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "⏳ How Efficient Is It?\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(n²) (not great for large datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Use: More swaps = more memory operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Bubble Sort is like tidying your desk one item at a time. It works, but if the desk is really messy (aka a big, unsorted list), you'll wish you had a better method!\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you're organizing a bookshelf, but instead of numbers, you're sorting books **alphabetically** by their titles. You pick up a book, find the right spot, and insert it—shifting others as needed. That’s **Insertion Sort** in action!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🔎 How It Works**  \n",
    "1️⃣ Start with the first student—it’s already in the right place.  \n",

    "3️⃣ If their name belongs earlier in the list, **shift other entries** to make room.  \n",
    "4️⃣ Repeat until every student is neatly arranged.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **📌 Key Observations**  \n",
    "✅ **Looks inside each student dictionary** to access and compare names.  \n",
    "✅ **Minimal swaps**—instead, it mostly shifts entries around.  \n",
    "✅ **Stable sorting**—if two students have the same name, their original order is preserved!  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **⚠️ Limitations**  \n",
    "💨 **Slower for big lists**—like sorting a huge library one book at a time.  \n",

    "- **Great for nearly sorted lists** (it moves fewer elements).  \n",
    "- Works efficiently for **small datasets**.  \n",
    "- **No extra memory** required—it sorts everything in place!  \n",
    "\n",
    "🔻 **Why it struggles:**  \n",
    "- **Terrible for large, messy datasets**—too slow.  \n",
    "- Advanced sorting methods like QuickSort and MergeSort make it look outdated.  \n",

    "#### **🟢 Selection Sort – The \"Pick the Best, One by One\" Approach**\n",
    "Think of **Selection Sort** like choosing players for a sports team: you always pick the best player available first, then the second-best, and so on until the team is complete.\n",

    "🔹 **Why it's good:**  \n",
    "- **Simple** to understand and implement.  \n",
    "- Does **fewer swaps** than Bubble Sort.  \n",
    "\n",
    "🔻 **Where it falls short:**  \n",
    "- Always makes **O(n²) comparisons**—even if the list is mostly sorted.  \n",
    "- Unlike smarter algorithms, it **doesn’t adapt** to sorted sections.  \n",
